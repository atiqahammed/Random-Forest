# Random-Forest
Random forest is a method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes. In our database management course there was an assignment of implementing random forest. This is a simple implementation of random forest algorithm on a small data set.
